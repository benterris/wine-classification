    "The data we're looking to guess are the **country** of production, the  **province** of production, and the **grape variety**.  \n",

      "This is a rich and full-bodied wine. While it is certainly packed with crunchy cherry flavors, it also has a more tannic and structured side giving it a firm texture to back up the fruitiness. The aftertaste is juicy and ripe.\n",
      "Actual: France, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Generic berry aromas come with herbal, earthy accents and a lactic note. The palate on this Malbec-led blend is grabby, while flavors of saline, roasted plum and berry finish with chocolaty weight.\n",
      "Actual: Argentina, predicted: Argentina\n",
      "\n",
      "This is complex, delicious, bold and tannic, bringing the big structure that is expected without being heavy handed. It offers concentrated blackberry and fig aromas, richly jammy flavors that stay dry and a tannic but not tough texture.\n",
      "Actual: US, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Zesty Monterey acidity gives life to this Pinot and lifts it above being a mere candy bar. Yes, it's sweetish and direct in cherries, raspberries and cola, but that tang makes it easy to enjoy.\n",
      "Actual: US, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This youthful wine might just be holding some of its nuances back, but for now it's singularly minded in caramel and toffee with a baked-apple pie vibe, wrapped in generous oak.\n",
      "Actual: US, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Strong aromas of cassis, cocoa nibs, fresh mint sprigs, black currant leaf and licorice are the first things you experience with this wine. After that, the creamy mouth provides loads of black berry, plum and anise flavors that stay through the finish. A firmly structured and well-balanced Bordeaux-style blend.\n",
      "Actual: South Africa, predicted: South Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "Fresh green herbs and lime zest lend vibrance to this lighter-bodied bottling from Wiemer's 2015 vintage. White grapefruit and citrus are piercing and spry, finishing with a delightful edge of salt and crushed-stone. Drinks beautifully now but should develop well through 2028.\n",
      "Actual: US, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This carries true-to-variety flavors of peppery blackberry fruit, here cloaked in coffee and toast from aging in 40% new French and American oak barrels. The lemony acids contribute to the overall balance and ageworthy structure.\n",
      "Actual: Canada, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Marred by unripe asparagus notes, this Syrah is tough to like despite its smooth tannins and some good blackberry and chocolate fruit.\n",
      "Actual: US, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Fresh and zesty, with wet stones and talcum powder upfront, followed by apple and gardenia in the mouth. It's light-bodied and slightly off-dry with a short-to-medium finish redolent of white flowers. Drink now.\n",
      "Actual: US, predicted: Australia\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripe and weighty, this is a rich wine from the Pfaffenberg vineyard in Krems. It has spice as well as perfumed white fruits, a sense of structure and concentration. It feels warm with peach and white fruit flavors likely to develop along with acidity over the next 3–4 years.\n",
      "Actual: Austria, predicted: Austria\n",
      "\n",
      "Although it's young, this wine has seen some time in oak, which has given it a ripe fruity character balanced by toast. It's rich and full with balancing acidity and a spicy aftertaste. It needs to age a few months, so drink from 2016.\n",
      "Actual: Portugal, predicted: Portugal\n",
      "\n",
      "This is beautifully lilting in preciously defined aromas of rose petal and wild strawberry. From there, it's all subtlety and ethereal elegance. The wine is restrained, nurtured in a basket of nutmeg and graham cracker, as well as freshly packed mushroomy earth. This wine is a stunner right out of the glass, but is sure to continue its fine course through 2022–2025.\n",
