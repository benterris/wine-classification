The mouthfeel is rich and balanced, while flavors of baked apple, vanilla cream and woodspice are endearing. Long and flavorful on the finish, and not overoaked. A serious Chardonnay to drink now.\n",

      "Dark golden in color, this late-harvest Riesling, which was allowed to develop botrytis after two October 2011 storms, has knockout, sweet honey and apricot goodness from start to finish. It's round and concentrated, and it has 12.9% residual sugar. Incredible on its own, this will also pair well with peach- and pineapple-based desserts, foie gras and blue cheeses.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweeter, more developed aromas of caramel, candied red apple, Boston baked beans and honeydew develop on the nose, while the mouth shows more typical Chard notes of baked apple and hazelnut butter. A touch round and flabby, but ends with a long, delicious, vanilla-kissed finish.\n",

      "This limited-production, aged wine incorporates 8% Merlot, sourcing grapes from several vineyards across the Napa Valley. Blueberry pie and sweet tobacco rise to the fore around an elegantly crafted structure, while soft, firm tannins provide just enough grip to stay juicy and compelling on the palate. It finishes with notes of chocolate, caramel and baking spice.\n",

Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink.\n",
      "Actual: Piedmont, predicted: Italy\n",

      "This has a dry finish with modest alcohol, and its emphasis is on phenolic flavors rather than the usual floral-perfumed aromas that characterize most versions of the grape.

      "Actual: Southwest France, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Swathes of fruit come across this ripe wine. To balance, it has a gritty structure that is firm in its tannins. It's a ripe, lightly perfumed wine that will age. Drink from 2017.\n",

      "\n",
      "This blend of 70% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 5% Mourvèdre features surprisingly dark fruit flavors akin to blackberries and cola. A hint of mint or eucalyptus enlivens the bouquet and helps to lighten this otherwise rather full-bodied, brooding wine.

      "\n",
      "A blend of grapes from Cumières in the Marne Valley and the Côte des Blancs, this is a rich, well-balanced and very young brut rosé.

      "\n",
      "Evocatively tender notes of Conference pear appear on the nose. The palate is ample with juicy pear and has a generous dollop of residual sweetness.

      "Actual: Alsace, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "This wine highlights heady new-oak tones of spice, vanilla and cedar, yet maintains elegance from nose to finish. Ripe black cherry and plum flavors penetrate on the palate, with a framing of soft tannins and bright cranberry acidity. The finish is long and a touch mineral.\n",
      "Actual: New York, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Fresh and young, this offers scents of violets, plummy fruit and a wash of root beer. Lively in the mouth, it has a leesy minerality that underscores rather light, pretty, but simple fruit. Drink up while it retains its freshness.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Red berry aromas and cherry and candied fruit are backed by spice, horsehide and tobacco. The mouthfeel is thinner, streamlined and still a bit raw.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "An eccentric wine. Rather heavy for a classic coastal Pinot Noir, yet not without charismatic charm. Shows rich, deep flavors of wild raspberries, toffee, vanilla bean and smoky wood. Gathers momentum and interest as it breathes in the glass. Could substitute for everything from Zinfandel to Grenache. Drink now.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",

      "An interesting note of sweet smoke graces the nose of this Merlot, adding another layer to the otherwise traditional characteristics of rich black berry and dark plum guts. Round and satisfying in the mouth with approachable tannins and a medium finish.\n",
      "Actual: Western Cape, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Sea salt, honeysuckle, lemon-sprayed apple and a touch of graphite dominate the nose of this tasty wine that grows only more interesting with time. Lime zest plays on the edges of the palate, though the middle shows a nectarine and yellow-pear richness. Energetic acidity tickles the tongue throughout the sip.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeasty and gaseous at first, then earthy and smoky. The palate is crisp, wet and fresh, with dry plum, cherry and a hint of cooked brown sugar. Finishes solid and sweet, and overall the wine elicits little to no complaints.\n",
      "Actual: Catalonia, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "Big and blasting on the nose, with heat and burn. The palate is high-wire boysenberry and a lot of acid, and ultimately it borders on sour and fiery, which probably isn't the intention. Wiry and piercing for a pricey, 800-case-production Malbec.\n",
      "Actual: Mendoza Province, predicted: Argentina\n",
      "\n",
      "Much riper than the previous vintage, this retains those complex aromatics, with cocoa powder, rose petals and chocolate highlights around ripe raspberry and cherry fruit. It is a graceful, precise and delicious wine, buttressed with fresh non-chalky acidity, baking spices and a hint of ginger. The long outstanding finish suggests tucking a few bottles away for enjoyment over the next decade.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Pressed iris, violet, dark-skinned berry and cake spice aromas unfold in the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, sage and clove alongside firm, velvety tannins. You'll notice the warmth of alcohol on the finish but the juicy fruit keeps it in check. Drink 2018–2028.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",

      "\n",
      "Buttered nuts, lime spritz, green apple, fragrant honeydew and a shred of pineapple treat the nose on this bottling from a steadily rising appellation. The palate shows lots of pep, blending both light crème fraîche with lemon and lime peels, quite focused though not terribly complex.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This has memorable aromas of warm hat, green herbs and perfumed fruit candy. It is a delicious wine that has been aged in cask before bottling.\n",

      "\n",
      "This blend of 55% Syrah, 29% Grenache, 10% Mourvèdre and 6% Counoise offers boisterous yet elegant aromas of blackberry, boysenberry and dried violet that are met with hints of crushed marjoram and white pepper. Once sipped, mulberry and exotic plum flavors mesh with wild mint on a brooding yet bright and fresh palate.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Shows the classic briary, brambly character of Dry Creek Valley, with wild berry and pepperspice flavors. Loses a bit of luster from excessive alcohol, which gives the wine a hot sweetness, and excessive new oak.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Chorey-lès-Beaune, on the plain just north of Beaune, can offer—as here—good value for Burgundy. This wine, still showing some young austerity, has the potential to develop into a bold, fruity selection that will always have a firmer structured edge.\n",
      "Actual: Burgundy, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "A delicately balanced Prosecco with a touch of white pepper and dried herbs that make a pretty frame to peach cream aromas. The wine has a fine point of sweetness in the mouth and would pair well with Thai curry dishes.\n",
      "Actual: Veneto, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this wine starts off a bit stern in texture, by the long finish those tannins have turned velvety and plush, nicely framing intense black olive, espresso, cherry and plum flavors. Drink now–2018.\n",
      "Actual: Rhône Valley, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a food-friendly rosé that's full-bodied and rich. It has orange and apricot flavors, along with a note of red plum. The acidity keeps the wine fresh and crisp while the aftertaste has a fine tang of zest. Screwcap.\n",
      "Actual: Provence, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Aromas of raw oak, vanilla, balsamic vinegar and olive crowd out blackberry and cassis notes. This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend feels a bit reduced and choppy. Herbal berry and chocolate flavors finish dry due to hard, almost abrasive tannins.\n",
      "Actual: Maipo Valley, predicted: Chile\n",

      "Soft and supple, this wine aims to please across a wide range of palates, offering mellowed tannins and oak around a layering of plum, cherry and cinnamon.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This wine's aromas are slightly reserved at first, recalling yellow pear and chalk. The flavors are also restrained on the zippy palate, with Asian pear and honeysuckle hints. But what it lacks in expressivity it makes up for in crispness and textural grip.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Deliciously sweet and perfumed, its powerful plum fruit flavors make this wine already accessible. In the background are the tannins—solid and concentrated—and the acidity, creating a nervous tension that confirms the wine's aging potential. Hold for many years.\n",
      "Actual: Port, predicted: France\n",

      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "The bouquet of this wine starts off quiet and nuanced, with subtle whiffs of melon rind, white peach and white flowers. Bright and lively on the palate, it offers more pronounced fruit flavors of ripe peach, lychee and sweet clementine. Balanced and refreshing; an ideal partner to enjoy now with ethnic take-out.\n",
      "Actual: Elgin, predicted: South Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "Tempranillo is carving out an important role for itself in southern Oregon. This young wine has a strong mineral streak around flavors of wild berry, citrus oil, and chalk. A light and lovely tobacco scent adds interest.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Ripe, fleshy and opulent, this wine is also balanced and light on its feet, cohesive in oak and tannin. Dark cherry is the star, accented by anise, cola spice and a compelling hint of orange peel. Medium bodied, it'll pair well at the table, while also standing out on its own.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "As the name Barriques suggests, this wine is lightly aged in wood that adds toast to spice and gives a buttery, ripe texture. The wine is fresh, rounded with a pepper character that comes through strongly at the end. Drink now, but better from 2016.\n",
      "Actual: Alsace, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "A streak of confectionary nougat and lemony acidity combine for a smooth, well-integrated wine, full bodied in style, that's lip-smacking in apple-cider juiciness on the finish.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Sturdy and basic, this Pinot Noir has vegetal aromas, modest fruit flavors, and a dry, lean texture. Aromas suggest tomato and herbs, while flavors are more rich.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Two types of wood barrels were used to age this wine: large chestnut and smaller oak. The wood shows although it does not detract from the tightly crisp and aromatic fruitiness of the Bical grape. It is lively at the end with plenty of bright acidity. Drink now.\n",
      "Actual: Bairrada, predicted: Portugal\n",
      "\n",
      "Too ripe, almost Porty, although it's bone dry. Shows flavors of currants, chocolate and raisins, with a bitterness throughout.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Côte Chalonnaise gives a fruity while structured style of red Burgundy. It's juicy, with red cherries and berries giving a bright character behind the still-present tannic structure. It's ready to drink, although it will be better in 2015.\n",
      "Actual: Burgundy, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Starts off with a minerally, slightly fumé-style note, then adds herbal and leafy notes and white grapefruit flavors. From New Zealand's first carbon-neutral winery, this medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc is appealingly long, crisp and clean on the finish.\n",
      "Actual: Marlborough, predicted: New Zealand\n",
      "\n",
      "Fresh dill, dewy herbs and a seared lemon-syrup scent makes for a dense but not treacly nose on this wine by a producer on the fringes of Gilroy. A chive accent holds attention once sipped, with a chalky minerality and a white-pepper finish, altogether proving brisk and elegant.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",

      "Actual: Northern Spain, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "A wood-aged wine from the heart of the Dão, it has tannins, a tense mineral structure and layer after layer of black currant fruit and acidity. Dark and brooding at this stage, it needs to age for several years. Drink from 2016.\n",
      "Actual: Dão, predicted: Portugal\n",
      "\n",
      "This blend from Cádiz features Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's big, ripe and minty on the nose, with hints of animal fur and leather. A blocky, full palate weighs in at 15.5%, while flavors of oak and vanilla blend well with spiced berry fruit. A drying finish tastes mostly of oak. Drink through 2025.\n",
      "Actual: Andalucia, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "A peachy, fruit-forward, mouthfilling wine that brings bright Washington fruit—peaches, apples and pears—into play, along with caramel candy and underlying acid support. It falls short only in the finish, which turns slightly bitter and attenuated.\n",
      "Actual: Washington, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Touches of ginger and orange zest lighten up the ample fruit flavors of this well-balanced value-priced wine. It has good acidity to match the ripeness of the Anjou pear and white peach flavors.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "This is made using a selection of fruit that's sourced from both banks of the Serein River. It's a properly crisp Chardonnay, and it offers a white fruit flavor and a bright, lively finish.\n",
      "Actual: Burgundy, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a warm and round wine from Irancy, southwest of Chablis. Red fruits are sustained by some wood aging that smoothes out the stalky texture and spice. It's a wine that could age another couple of years to soften it further.\n",
      "Actual: Burgundy, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "88—90 Barrel sample. A wine with a high wood content, maybe too much – the question is over the fruit's ability to stand up to the blast of wood. The result is a wine that is super-spicy.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Asphalt and gaseous aromas take a while to settle, but after they do, leather and scratchy blackberry scents surface. It feels big and brawny, with max extraction. It tastes masculine but salty, with bitter chocolate and peppery accents. Bulky for $11 wine.\n",
      "Actual: Mendoza Province, predicted: Spain\n",

      "\n",
      "The vintage was cool, lending this wine strong acidity that cuts through the mouth like a squirt of lime juice. Dry and austere, it offers oak-influenced sour-cherry candy and cola flavors. This should develop bottle complexity over the next 3–6 years.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark in color and aromas. The nose starts out sulfuric and gassy, but settles on rubber and earthy black fruit. In the mouth, there's poking, prodding acidity and basic flavors of blackberry, herbal tea and leather. Grabby on the finish, with a mild acidic scour.\n",

      "\n",
      "A blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of oak, rubber and unusual sensations that recall petrol. There's more oak than fruit on the palate, delivering toasted oak, espresso, vanilla and coffee alongside hints of black cherry. It closes on an astringent, tannic note.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "This vineyard designate is 100% whole cluster fermented, an interesting study on the grape. Floral and earthy with lavender and black licorice aromas, it imparts substantial oak and tannin beneath its light rendering of black cherry fruit.\n",

      "\n",
      "A pure Sauvignon Blanc, unusual in Pessac-Léognan, which normally also includes Sémillon. This is a purely fresh wine, but with a serious aging potential side to it. For now, the white fruits, currants and pears are delicious, with fresh structure and a touch of wood spice. Screwcap.\n",

      "Chardonnay doesn't get much richer or riper than this. Explodes with grilled pineapple, lemondrop, smoky meringue, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, brightened and boosted by crisp, citrusy cool-climate acidity.

      "Actual: Virginia, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "The Huber Vineyard is one of the few places where this grape grows in America, and the wine is always fascinating. Extremely dark in color, it offers unctuous black currant, graphite and licorice aromas.

While Yarden's T2 dry blend of Touriga Nacional and Tinta Cao is a very good wine, this sweet Port-style wine misses the mark. With a nose of blackberry preserves, cassis and rose petal—and flavors of blackberry, cassis, licorice and clove—it should be gorgeous in the mouth.

      "You'll have to look in the very lower left hand corner of the back label to spot the vintage on this bottle (2014). The soft cherry fruit has a buttery mouthfeel. The wine is lightly toasty and eminently accessible. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Medicinal berry aromas are outweighed by a strong blast of clove. While this feels wide and chunky, it's also acidic. Following the nose, this tastes heavily of clove along with plum, currant and raspberry. On the finish, there's no shedding that dominant oak-based clove character.\n",
      "Actual: Maipo Valley, predicted: Spain\n",

      "Oak extract dominates the nose on this wine together with aromas of Golden Delicous apple and lemon zest. The palate offers lemon, oak, vanilla and clove, but it lacks the fruit richness needed to support the oak.\n",

      "\n",
      "Warm tones of marzipan, roasted almond, yellow peach, pineapple and a touch of coconut are reminiscent of a piña colada on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard just behind the coastal town of Cambria. Gala apples and poached pears show on the sip along with lemon curd, chalk and meringue flavors, all tightly woven into a fresh expression of the grape.\n",

      "Made up of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon and 36% Tempranillo, this wine offers an intensity of leather and dark plum, a whiff of smoky tobacco hanging in the background, too. With a pronounced tannic structure and big finish, it's a burly wine made for burly barbecue-inspired meals.\n",

      "\n",
      "This nonvintage, Bordeaux-style blend is predominately grapes from the 2012 harvest, with a small addition of 2011 to add balance. The nose is spice-driven, with tart currant and green peppercorn pervading. The palate shows a bit more ripeness, offering tart plum and blackberry up front, but leads to a slightly green and astringent finish.\n",

      "The Cesari family has perfected its formula for achieving pure pleasure in liquid form.

      "Light, clean and citrusy aromas of lemon, lime and grapefruit skin meet with a dollop of white peach and dusting of crushed slate on the nose of this wine. A fine-pointed acidity carries nectarine, pluot and Asian pear flavors across the palate, which trends racy, bright and slightly sour, with a chalky structure.\n",

      "There isn't enough fruit on this high flier to give it the unqualified seal of approval. In fact, for $50 it has its issues, namely a nose of boot polish and grainy oak. Seems like the fruit is fading and what's left besides some light raspberry is unabsorbed oak and thin, grabby tannins. Not a bad wine per se but not a big success either.\n",
      "Actual: Central Valley, predicted: Chile\n",

      "The dark fruits are all but buried by flavors of roasted coffee, charred wood and black licorice. Two bottles tasted, the second showed a bit more cherry, but again, the longer the wine remained open, the more the fruit disappeared.

      "Actual: Languedoc-Roussillon, predicted: South Africa\n",
      "\n",
      "A confectionary aspect to the bouquet of this wine dances near to marshmallow and nougat. On the palate, it tells a different story, offering crisp, savory peach and citrus, all within a low-intensity package that speaks more to acidity than to power.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mint and eucalyptus combine to offer a forest full of aromas and intrigue upon the entry of this wine. The presence of mild tannins makes for an elegant decadence that begs for food—the fruit as tart as dried cranberry and currant chiseled in bittersweet clove.\n",

      "\n",
      "A fresh, fruity and sophisticated wine, this offers acidity balanced by dry tannins. It has juicy black currant fruits, hints of mint and a bright, smoky feel. The wine will obviously age, so drink from 2016.\n",

      "\n",
      "This blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier is fancy, elegant and enjoyable to drink now. It has that indefinable quality of luxe, bearing a smooth, creamy texture, with rich fruit, yeast and toast complexities. With a production of 5,000 cases, it should be relatively easy to find.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",

      "Estrecho means narrow in Spanish, and this varietal Monastrell is just that. After a compact, pure nose sets the stage, this feels sharp and puckery, with cheek-scouring acidity. The result is tart, bright cherry, currant and plum flavors followed by a high-toned, citric finish. Drink through 2024.\n",

      "Predominantly Merlot, this Bordeaux-style blend includes 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Cab Franc and 11% Malbec.

      "\n",
      "This is rather soft on entry, a buttery, meaty, forward and appealing Pinot, with a layered palate of black raspberry, black cherry, sassafras, cinnamon and vanilla bean. The tannins are substantial and a bit green, but the edges are nicely honed, and the green tea bitterness is largely held in abeyance. The wine carries its 14.5% alcohol with graceful charm.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",

      "A fine effort, this is full bodied and creamy in texture. High alcohol buoys the mulberry fruit, while hints of cedar, mocha and smoke add nuance. It's slightly warm and peppery on the finish, a pleasing finale to a mouthfilling wine.\n",

A minute-plus finish adds licorice and mint; even after being opened for a full 48 hours this wine remained fresh and balanced. It's the first varietal Malbec ever from Walla Walla Vintners, but certainly one hopes it is not the last.\n",

      "Seems a bit on the woody side for now, boasting aromas of dark roasted coffee backed by hints of plummy fruit. The cedary, coffee-tinged oak continues on the palate, where it imparts a slightly dry, tannic edge to this otherwise supple, rounded wine.

      "Actual: Marlborough, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Barely there whiffs of honey, cantaloupe and tangerine intensify on the palate of this bright, fruity wine. It's lip-smackingly plump in yellow plum and cherry flavors, but tows a precise line of acidity that's refreshing. Drink now through 2020.\n",

Hard to imagine a wine richer in currants and mocha, and the tannins are as beautiful as any Napa has ever produced. But it's difficult to see the wine aging well, so drink it soon with the most Cabernet-friendly food you can find.\n",

      "Actual: Washington, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "So ripe and lush with fruit, this could only be from California. It assaults the palate with blackberries, cherries and mocha, but with an interesting, earthy green olive note. Oak adds predictable but rich notes of buttered toast. The tannins are soft enough for you to drink this lovely wine now, but you can age it for 6–8 years if you want.\n",

      "\n",
      "Huge, rich and flamboyant, this hasa sweetness at its core—like the essence of red and black currants, with an elaborate note of caramel imparted from smoky oak. Yet everything about it is utterly and properly dry.

      "Tight, earthy, spiced up with leaf and pepper, this old vine Zin gathers strength in the mid-palate and displays a perfect blend of sweet cherry, berry and some finishing tomato leaf. This 2007 seems a bit less ripe than previous efforts, so the fruit does not have the same sweetness, but the winemaking is exceptional and the flavors are woven beautifully. These 2007s may yet prove to be among the most ageworthy wines that Sineann has ever made.\n",

      "\n",
      "The softness of the 2000 vintage is reflected in this delicious, gentle, ripe wine. It is full of soft red fruits, lifted easily by the fresh red currant acidity and cranberry texture. It is showing signs of maturity, but still has several years to develop.\n",

      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "A Pinot in the ultralight style. There’s cranberry and tea qualities, and an almost weightless mouthfeel. No new oak renders it clean and fruity, with plenty of fresh-berry essence. In the end, it’s a lightweight that closes with licorice and anise notes.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This is small-production, old-vines Cariñena with the full allotment of French oak aging. It is a little syrupy on the nose, but its schisty blackberry and licorice aromas and flavors give it a Priorat quality.

      "Actual: Catalonia, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "Based around the 2013 vintage, this wine is young. Perfumed apple and pineapple fruits are tightly laced with lemon and crisp acidity. These contrast with the creamy mousse that adds a softer touch. Age this bottling until 2018.\n",

      "Eola Hills Pinots often offer this sort of interesting flavors—a mix of earth, herb and forest; the red fruit is tart and the tannins hard. A wine to cellar, it already shows depth and penetration, with a darker, smoky streak in the finish.\n",

      "\n",
      "Bright and plump fruits of black plum and boysenberry are drizzled with tar and dusted with savory peppercorns on the nose of this bottling, which also has a gamy hint of roast lamb. The palate is a tad thin but full of flavor, with boysenberry, lavender and thyme flavors.\n",

      "Comes on full and lush from the opening, with blackberry, chocolate, menthol and smoke aromas. In the mouth it delivers dark, dry flavors of plum, cassis and toasty oak and has good acidity that keeps it from getting mushy.

      "Mature, ripe aromas of raisin, caramel, tobacco and fine oak form a pleasing, inviting bouquet. Drawing, edgy and still quite tannic in feel, this tastes rooty, baked and lightly stewed, with just enough berry and plum fruit to prop things up.

      "A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll.

Low cropping of Dijon clone 76 has concentrated the flavors (and the alcohol—a surprising 15.7%) without turning the wine into an overblown fat boy.

      "A gritty but well-made wine with aromas of crushed brick, red pepper flake, earth and sandalwood. The palate is tightly wound and mildly tannic, with semisweet flavors of black plum, fig, black cherry and chocolate. Shows a medicinal edge on the finsih, but nothing too drastic.\n",
      "Actual: Mendoza Province, predicted: US\n",

      "Because this producer is in the southern Minho region, away from the northern Alvarinho vineyards, the wine is registered as Minho rather than Vinho Verde.

      "The most floral of Ponzi's single-vineyard Pinots, this is a delicate and yet powerful wine, scented with lavender and roses, and displaying bright, clean raspberry fruit. Stiff acids and grippy tannins support a wine that is locked down tightly and needs decanting and/or aerating to open up.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",

      "From the relatively hot South Coast comes a big, powerful, chewy wine, with aromas of dried blackberries, light leather, some smoke and purple flowers.

      "In general, Eola Hills Pinots lean more to the peppery and herbal side of the line, compared with pricier AVAs in Yamhill county. This well-made wine shows good color and concentration, and it's ripe enough that the herbaceousness is a feature, if not entirely an asset. There's a nice lift to the midpalate, which leaves a residual impression that finishes a bit vinegary, as the wine winds down into flavors of black olive and herb.\n",

      "In 2001, Aliénor and Alexandre de Malet Roquefort bought this property which is 15 minutes southeast of their Château La Gaffelière. From 8.5 acres of Sauvignon Blanc, Sémillon and Muscadelle, this is a rounded, soft wine that promises well. It is going towards the tropical fruit area with its apricot and pineapple flavors. Behind, the acidity is tangy and crisp with a tight, nervy aftertaste.\n",

      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Fresh green florals and melon rind lend a breathlessly cool tone to this elegantly composed dry Riesling. Forward flush yellow plum and gooseberry flavors are offset by lime zest, fresh sage and bristling acidity. It finishes with persistence and length.

      "\n",
      "This gorgeous dessert wine shows a coffee-colored tint that's backed by lush, deep aromas of fig, caramel, toffee and prune.

      "Actual: Andalucia, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if there's an herbal leaning and some tomato to the nose, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère, Malbec and Cab Franc is elegant and balanced.

      "\n",
      "Rich in baked apple pie and ripe pear, this late-harvest Chenin Blanc, sourced from the Norgard Vineyard and named for Graziano's daughter, has pleasant acidity and isn't cloying or heavy. Smooth from start to finish, pair it with apple desserts or roasted nuts.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This twist-top bottling is bolstered by 15% Petite Sirah but remains a bit wound up and tight on the nose, with caramelized blackberry, caramel and chocolate syrup notes. The mouthfeel is soft and lush, with black cherry flavors cut by graphite, wild sage and bay leaf accents.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "French oak, coconut, underbrush and a balsamic aroma follow through to the full-bodied palate along with licorice, espresso, dried cherry and raw cranberry.

      "\n",
      "Smells Porty, like chocolate-covered raisins, and turns rather heavy in the mouth, although very dry. Tastes roasted, with grilled blackberry and cedar flavors. This style is characteristic of the winery and often of this vineyard, on the east side of the Rutherford flatlands.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Briny notes of oyster shell blend with spicy barrel notes and core apple aromas on the bouquet of this crisp, pure, minerally Chardonnay. Flavors of apple, quince, orange marmalade and minerals finish sturdy and secure.\n",
      "Actual: Mendoza Province, predicted: Chile\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very good price for a Zinfandel this fine. It's fairly delicate in mouthfeel for a Zin, with a light silkiness, and the tannin-acid architecture is elegant. As for the actual flavors, they're intense in red fruits, currants, sweet licorice and pepper. Hard to imagine a better wine for drinking over the next few years with barbecue.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a slight sweetness to this simple sipper but the pretty, ripe strawberries and strawberry-leaf characters, along with a decent lick of acidity, keep it refreshing. For the price, this fizz is one for the ice bucket on a sweltering summer day.\n",
      "Actual: Australia Other, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely delicious, offering a flood of ripe, sweet blackberry, blueberry, currant, chocolate, anise and spice flavors. Impressive for its savory power, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Verdot will easily ride out the next 8–10 years.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",

      "\n",
      "This very appealing wine smells like a Danish pastry but then turns nicely dry on the palate, gushing with crisp apple, ripe Bosc pear and toasted-baguette flavors. Made from Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes, it's medium bodied, complex and well balanced.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "A pretty wine, with a touch of wintergreen mint and bacon fat adding complexity to the blackberries, cherries and cassis. Co-fermented with some Viognier, it's vibrant in the mouth, with a welcome cut of acidity to brighten and uplift the fruit. A flashy, elegant, opulent Syrah to drink over the next several years.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Light and murky, with a flavor mix of tomato, vegetable juice, celery, barely ripe berries and thin acids. That sounds worse than it is; taste this alongside a Bourgogne from a big shipper in a cool vintage and you wouldn't see much difference. The alcohol here is listed at just 12.5%. It's a serviceable everyday wine, but not priced accordingly.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",

      "This veers toward the sweet side of Viognier, with pineapple, apricot, orange and honeysuckle flavors. The sweetness is balanced by firm acidity.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "A Merlot-based blend with accompanying components of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this estate-grown wine excels in its subdued, smoky and toasty oak surrounded by juicy blackberry and a hint of graphite and leather. Textured and structured, it needs time, and will be happy in the cellar through 2026.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Whispers of leather and granitic soil lend rugged appeal to this slightly savory, subdued Merlot. Bright acidity adds lift and light to the midpalate, accentuating flavors of crisp black cherry and cassis. It's supple and round, yet finishes curt and brisk.\n",
      "Actual: New York, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "The beauty of this wine is that it shows seductive power and personality. Nothing is over the top. Cortevecchia Riserva doles out carefully measured aromas of forest fruit, spice, toasted nut and tobacco. It feels linear, bright and tight, but it is also elegant and soft.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "With cedar and tobacco aromas, and vivid black cherry and black currant flavors, this full-bodied red has lots of fruit character and complexity to match its firm tannins and bold texture. A welcome spice component from oak aging starts in the aroma and continues through the finish.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "A bright, sunny, yellow Chard through and through-and the cream-and-tropcial fruit nose is just the beginning. Peach, banana and vanilla flavors resurface on the palate; toasty-butterscotch flavors round out the back end. An instant mood-lifter. Drink now.\n",
      "Actual: South Australia, predicted: Spain\n",

      "Fragrant, clean and tropical, with slate-driven minerality. The palate is just fleshy enough but mostly it's tight and crisp, with flavors of green apple, fresh green herbs and a drip of honey. Holds it together from front to back; just right for salads and seafood-based tapas.\n",
      "Actual: Northern Spain, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Buoyantly fragrant, this voluptuous Chardonnay bursts of mango, guava and berry aromas. The palate is a bit more subdued, suggesting fresh apple and pear. Fruity, fresh and uncomplicated, it's balanced neatly by a flash of acidity on the midpalate. Drink now through 2019.\n",
      "Actual: New York, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "The bouquet reveals subtle notes of honey, white flower and peach blossom. This sweet sparkler also shows a milky or creamy note on the finish, with a softly sweet endnote.\n",
      "Actual: Piedmont, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "This score for a $22 Chilean Malbec may cause you to do a double-take, but this is really a great wine. The nose is chock full of berry aromas with earth and leather riding shotgun. Flavors and finishing notes of chocolate truffles, espresso, berry syrup and mocha sum it up. The structure is here, as is the core acidity. This wine has everything. Imported by Atlanta Improvement Co.\n",
      "Actual: Colchagua Valley, predicted: Chile\n",
      "\n",
      "This Riesling is an odd one. Aromas of yeast and peach blossom come with a note of cured ham, while the palate is sticky and low in acidity. Creamy, honeyed flavors alongside green melon, vanilla and yeast finish waxy and creamy.\n",
      "Actual: Casablanca Valley, predicted: Spain\n",

      "\n",
      "Typical of early-maturing, Merlot-based wines from this vintage, this is rich, swirling with black-berry fruits and generous tannins. The fresh, almost crisp aftertaste is already attractive. Drink from 2019.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "The second of the two wines made from organic grapes by La Chablisienne (the first is a Petit Chablis), this is soft, very clean and clear in its flavors, with a streak of minerality to give it texture. The aftertaste is full of fresh, crisp apples. Drink now.\n",
      "Actual: Burgundy, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "This distinctly woody wine's eucalyptus perfume derives from its wood aging. Luckily, that quality shares space with black fruit and dark fruit tannins. Dense and powerful, it needs time. Drink from 2021.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Made with Nerello Mascalese, this opens with aromas of flint, ripe orchard fruit and a whiff of baked bread. The dry palate shows red apple, flint, lemon drop and Mediterranean herb alongside bright acidity and a persistent, elegant perlage.\n",
      "Actual: Sicily & Sardinia, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "The dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich. Both the flavors and the texture seem shaped by subtly spicy oak. Fine-grained tannins add a velvety touch and the finish lingers.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "A soft, mid-range, medium-bodied Pinot Noir from areas including the Russian River Valley and Sonoma Coast, it imparts aromas of rosemary and herbes de Provence before delving into a world of tart cherry and cranberry. The finish is smoky.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This blend of two types of Garnacha and some Carignan is a consistently top performer from this Catalonian region. This edition smells reedy and spicy, but also like ripe plum and raisin.

      "Actual: Catalonia, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "With smoky aromas and structured tannins, this is still young and firm. Under those tannins, the black currant fruit is developing to give a ripe wine with fine acidity and structure. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "A very rich Chardonnay, explosive in lemon custard, grilled pineapple and the ripest peaches imaginable. At the same time, there's a firm, tangy minerality. Some will find, however, that the oak dominates it all with a blast of buttered toast and caramel.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Aromas of stewed prune, grilled pepper and roasted coffee bean join in this blend of 45% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Franc. The evolved palate shows date, vanilla and coconut. Drink sooner rather than later.\n",

      "A bouquet of floral cherry and plum aromas mixed with savory spice, fine oak and earth notes spans the full spectrum of Ribera del Duero. This has a jammy, wide, tannic mouthfeel and flavors of blackberry, boysenberry and chocolate. A wide, tannic finish with light herbal notes is rock solid. Drink through 2019.\n",

      "Earthy, moderately complex and mature aromas of lemon peel, dried red-berry fruits and sandalwood set up a tannic palate with vitality given that this is now nine-years-old. Earthy cherry and plum flavors are uncomplicated and finish tannic, with mildly leafy berry undertones. Drink through 2018.\n",

      "This sophisticated and beautifully balanced wine shows that Lodi can make crisp and poised whites. It has aromas like white pepper and dried thyme, crisp lemon flavors and racy acidity. It is nicely dry, clean and tautly refreshing. While medium bodied, it has a big, vibrant presence.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Wonderful notions of ivy leaves, citrus peel and conifer greet the nose. The aromatic impression leads onto a slender, dry and fluid palate that still seems tightly coiled and closed. But those subtle aromatic hints and a concentrated, stony palate promise future pleasure. This will blossom into a perfumed marvel. Drink 2019–2030.\n",
      "Actual: Alsace, predicted: Austria\n",
      "\n",
      "This wine is a blend of Roussanne (58%), Marsanne (21%) and Grenache Blanc from Olsen and Boushey vineyards. Unusual aromas of apricot, herb, lees, toasted Grape-nuts and candle wax lead to waxy stone-fruit flavors. It doesn't all come together.\n",
      "Actual: Washington, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This blended study of 2A, 115, 667 and Pommard clones shows black pepper, red cherry, pressed purple flowers, eucalyptus and a touch of hot asphalt on the nose. The lean and light palate conveys lots of dried herbs and raspberry-cranberry juice, enlivening the tongue with sourness.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This wine is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (58%), Merlot (28%), Syrah (9%) and Malbec. Aromas of macerated cherries, baking spice and cranberry are followed by sweet fruit flavors. It brings a slight sense of astringency but otherwise delivers the goods.\n",
      "Actual: Washington, predicted: US\n",

      "A wonderfully aromatic nose presents orange blossom and tangerine zest, Seville orange and ripe mandarin. All of these notions are joyously bundled on the concentrated dry palate that is brightened with even more zesty lemon freshness. There is drive here and an arrow-like structure that is energetic and totally refreshing. Uncompromising freshness, expressed with exuberant citrus charm, enlivens everything. The absolutely dry finish is invigorating and lasting. Drink 2018–2035.\n",
      "Actual: Alsace, predicted: Austria\n",
      "\n",
      "The winemaking team of Château Lafite makes one of the better branded Bordeaux. This 2006 has tobacco aromas followed by flavors of fresh black currants with an attractive smoky character and a fine line of balancing acidity.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "The blend is Sangiovese, Cabernet and Merlot, and this, the estate's second wine, is a less intense, less sophisticated interpretation, with lingering notes of bright fruit and light smoke.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "A rich, lusty and satisfying Zinfandel, showing classic varietal flavors of ripe, wild red berries, tobacco, soy sauce, bacon and white pepper. Alcohol is notable in the slight heat and glyceriny sweetness, but those elements are welcome parts of the wine's personality. Drink now.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Sweet and baked smelling, with foxy core aromas that suggest wet dog fur. The palate is loud and wild, with foxy, unsettled flavors of wild berry and cherry. Runs low on layering, structure and body, but it is lively.\n",
      "Actual: Mendoza Province, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "Longboard shies away from overt fruit in favor of earthier tobacco flavors in this dry, complex and tannic young Pinot Noir. That doesn't mean you won't find plenty of raspberries and cherries. The wine is dry, delicately structured and frankly delicious, making it Longboard's best Pinot Noir ever. Drink now–2019 as it gradually sheds fruit.\n",

      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Solid tannins and rich fruit come together in this ripe, still-young wine. It has good potential, with bold black fruit and a dense, mineral texture. It will need several years for those tannins to soften. Drink from 2021.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially rustic, this is likely to develop into a dry, firmly tannic wine. The acidity and red berry notes come together in balance, but it does need serious aging to develop fully. Drink from 2018.\n",
      "Actual: Tejo, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "One of Foxen's block designates from the historic property, this offers scents of purple flowers, black soil and sharp dill. It's quite smooth once sipped and not very complicated, but with fresh raspberry and brown spice.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Firm and solidly structured, this is a dense wine. It has plenty of tannins and a touch of bitter chocolate, but they are supported by the ripe fruit and fresh black currant flavors. It's a wine for aging, drink from 2017.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Underbrush, chopped aromatic herb, wild berry and a hint of new leather are the main scent notes. The bright, structured palate is full of layers of juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, mint and tobacco set against a backbone of chewy tannins. It's already accessible, and while not loaded with complexity, it is delicious. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "Dusty clay and spice notes lend savory nuances to high-impact peach, nectarine and lemon in this mouthwatering Riesling. It's boldly fruity and lip-smackingly sweet-tart. Vibrant acidity leads a long luminous finish.\n",

      "\n",
      "Delicate aromas of pressed white flower, tree fruit, citrus and slate lead the nose on this elegant, structured white. The vibrant palate offers juicy yellow peach, Granny Smith apple, nectarine skin and bitter almond alongside crisp acidity. The lingering finish has a mineral accent.\n",
      "Actual: Lombardy, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a solid wine from a new appellation, offering much promise for vintages to come. Baked red cherry, smashed pomegranate, cinnamon and bay leaf play on the nose, while anise, light clove, strawberry, red plum and red apple vie for attention on the palate.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "A four-acre parcel of old vines is the source of this dense and rich wine. It has jammy red berry and cherry fruits that are lifted by the mineral texture and acidity. The wine is balanced although it does need to age. Drink from the end of 2017.\n",
      "Actual: Beaujolais, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Cola, cherries, dried violets, iodine and a slight bit of forest floor funk introduce the nose to this top-end bottling from the biodynamic-minded winery. There is quite a bit of aromatic spice on the palate, from wild mint to pine and juniper, all set against a cranberry fruit character. The tannins are light and acidity is just right.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Castello d'Albola's Chianti Classico has a typical fragrance of ripe berry accented with hints of violet and spice. The bright palate delivers ripe, red cherry and white pepper along with round tannins. Pair it with pasta topped with ragù or barbecued steaks.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "The rich fruit and structure of this impressive wine are already well integrated. With power and concentration as well as layers of dark fruits, it is showing fine aging potential. The wine, dominated by 80% Merlot, comes from vines in the east of Saint-Emilion. Drink from 2020.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "This wine is crisp, floral and pretty in every way. It's classically structured and graceful, with tart apple notes and stony acidity. It allows the fruit to speak softly and subtly, its lower ripeness detracting from niether flavor nor complexity.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfumed in rose and violet, with a sauvage scent of musk, this distinctive wine is soft and silky on the palate. It features a mix of red cherry and sage, with a full body and an expansive and lengthy finish.\n",

      "\n",
      "Cola, Dr. Pepper, cherry coke all come to mind, as this has a strong emphasis on those flavors, or sassafras as some define them. It's tasty, forward and light, with a lightly herbal aftertaste. Perfectly pleasant, though not showing much depth.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "An unusual tawny color blends with deep pink in this wine that conveys cinnamon aromas and persimmon flavors. It's certainly an unusual style but has its own appeal.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Aromas of acacia flower, fresh stone fruit and nut all come together in the glass. The juicy palate offers up white peach, green apple and a citrus note while crisp acidity provides support. Mineral and white almond notes delineate the finish.\n",
      "Actual: Veneto, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "While this is immensely oaky on the nose, that wood and char works because it comes with ripe cassis, blackberry and raisin scents. Chewy, ultraripe and tannic on the palate, this tastes of sweet black fruits, chocolaty oak and wood. An oaky reprise is front and center on a grabby stacked finish. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "Actual: Other, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "A ripe currant- and lime-flavored wine, this is rounded and soft. This full-bodied wine fills the mouth but maintains its delicate crispness. There are good bright highlights of green fruits and fresh acidity.\n",
      "Actual: Loire Valley, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "This has a very deep-red color with a reddish-purple rim, followed by very ripe, jammy aromas like boysenberry jam with spicy, smoky oak accents. Flavors are ripe, effusive and nearly sweet, as the wine goes for broke in terms of well-ripened grape flavors and generous helpings of sweet-spicy oak.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "A streak of waxy honeycomb seems to glaze flavors of pressed apple and pear on the palate of this savory, but honey-kissed wine. Light in body, it's zesty and spry with a clean, cutting finish.\n",
      "Actual: New York, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This expression of the Cannubi cru offers delicate tones of wild berry, forest floor, almond Amaretto, Spanish cedar, white truffle and cola. It has a direct and uplifting effect that brings those aromas straight to the nose. Clean berry flavors, bright acidity and polished tannins follow in the mouth. Drink after 2012.\n",
      "Actual: Piedmont, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "Barbera, Sangiovese and Nebbiolo comprise the wine. Half of the grapes were air dried for three months, which is known as appassimento. The Sangiovese was crushed and fermented conventionally before being added to the blend. The result is a dry, slightly nutty red wine, with tart flavors that are suggestive of fruit leather. It shows good grip and length, and it comes with just a bit of alcoholic heat.\n",
      "Actual: Washington, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "Rich and spicy, this is a smooth, wood-aged wine. It has ripe tannins and some concentrated fruits. With its acidity and dry aftertaste, it will certainly age.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: Portugal\n",
      "\n",
      "Firm and tight, a wine that reveals more structure than fruit initially, leaving the citrus and grapefruit flavors to emerge later. Then it closes up again, keeping some of the mineral austerity. Keep this wine for a year.\n",
      "Actual: Burgundy, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to Artesa's three other 2009 Pinot Noirs, this one's the least drinkable at this time. Although it's very extracted in cherry and raspberry fruit, it's jammy-simple, like a spoonful of marmalade, with a scour of acidity. Your best bet is to cellar it for 4–6 years and see what happens, but odds are you won't be disappointed.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Alcohol that reaches these levels is often a complexity killer, but not here. This is a stunningly delicious wine, with ripe, powerful and concentrated black fruits. Baking spices, tar, pencil lead, even a whiff of compost all add to the complexity and the depth of flavor is magnificent. This can age at least a decade but is delicious already!\n",
      "Actual: Washington, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Aromas of pear, yellow apples and pineapple carry over to the palate along with a banana note. The juicy palate is balanced by bright acidity, making this perfect for everyday fare from lightly seasoned fish to pasta topped with tomato sauce.\n",
      "Actual: Northeastern Italy, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "Aromas of blueberries, beef roast and fudge give way to a light, straightforward palate of purple fruit. It's a clean wine, but not very complex.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This blend of 43% Merlot, 26% Petit Verdot, 22% Carmenère, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Syrah offers orange peel, herb, raspberry and spice aromas that don't seem entirely knit together. Dry tannins back up its blue and black fruit flavors.\n",
      "Actual: Washington, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This radiant, fragrant Nebbiolo opens with a potpourri of scents including aromatic herb, leather, cedar, pressed rose petal and dark spice. The luminous, subtle palate is loaded with finesse, delivering juicy red cherry, cinnamon, star anise, white pepper and pipe tobacco. It's impeccably balanced, with noble tannins and bright acidity. Drink now or hold for even more complexity. Drink through 2032.\n",
      "Actual: Lombardy, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "Very characteristic of the variety, with perfumes of white flower, citrus, lemon soda and drying mineral tones. The wine offers intensity and precision with focused attention on acidity and citric freshness. Try with fried wontons or eggrolls.\n",
      "Actual: Veneto, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "Leafy aromas suggest forest underbrush, dried tobacco leaf and dried rose petals. The palate offers fading wild cherry, hints of cinnamon-spice and astringent, fleeting tannins. It seems fast forwarded by a decade, a trait of this vintage. Superior Wines, V I Wines Distributing.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "A savory hint of soy sauce spices the citrus hints on the nose. The palate is dry and reveals deeper fruit of yellow mirabelle plum and ripe apple. The dosage is restrained and the mousse is fine, all making for an elegant, fruit-driven fizz of rounded freshness.\n",
      "Actual: Alsace, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "This blend of wines from Dão, Bairrada and Lisboa is ripe, full of black fruits and with subtle signs of the wood aging. Named to celebrate the Portuguese mariners who sailed to the spice islands of the East Indies, it is warm with its own spiciness as well as a juicy aftertaste. Drink now.\n",
      "Actual: Portuguese Table Wine, predicted: Portugal\n",
      "\n",
      "From one of the westernmost vineyards in the county, just a few miles from the chilly Pacific, comes this dark, intense Pinot. Tasted in 2007, it was too tightly wound and too young to appreciate fully, with grapy, primary fruit flavors of blackberries, cherries and cola. It should be mellower now, however.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly rich, but this wine is also about purity of spicy fruit, bringing out the fresher side of the variety as well as the intensity.\n",
      "Actual: Alsace, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a soft wine with a great depth of red fruits and fresh acidity. The tannins are light, just a hint of dry behind the fragrant, bright fruitiness. The wine, made from old vines, is ready to drink.\n",
      "Actual: Beaujolais, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Peach aromas open a smooth wine. It has acidity certainly but also some good melon and pear ripeness. There is an herbaceous edge that cuts through the finish.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "A demanding, pushy wine with few rewards. The nose is aggressive with aromas of shoe polish, coffee and gamy fruit, and the palate turns jumpy and more acidic as it opens. Rough and tumble, yet concentrated. Imported by Orvino Imports.\n",
      "Actual: Molina, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark, spicy scents run side by side with licorice root and black cherry notes. This juicy, layered blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% each of Merlot and Syrah is a potent number with black- and red-plum flavors backed by a lasting, bold, angular finish. Drink through 2023.\n",
      "Actual: Levante, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "Soft suggestions of cigar ash and green pepper complement the fruity notes of small red berries and plum. Forward medium-grain tannins and prominent acidity supply a sturdy backbone to the wine, leading through to the anise-infused finish.\n",
      "Actual: Upper Galilee, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a fine, ripe wine with a good balance between crisp, mineral acidity and tangy lemon fruit. It has a peppery edge that gives a bite to the young fruit. It is ready to drink although it will be better from 2017.\n",
      "Actual: Loire Valley, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Oak aromas pervade on the nose and palate, with charred blackberries, freshly-ground coffee and dark chocolate notes showing dominance. Full-bodied, rich and thick, this brooding red is supported by grippy tannins that build on the finish.\n",

      "\n",
      "An opaque black color and gritty aromas of toast and tar announce a dense, saturated, warm-vintage Garnacha Tintorera that's pumping with herbal blackberry notes. A pinching, tannic finish is a bit abrasive, while this tastes of peppery black fruits, while the savory, oaky finish with stewed, gamy notes is intense. Drink through 2020.\n",
      "Actual: Northern Spain, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "Perfectly sweet, unctuous and rich, with lush coffee and cocoa aromas that indicate that complexity is coming. That promise is rewarded on the palate, which hits fifth gear in seconds flat. Flavorwise, it's complex and balanced, with good acidity forcing up orange and honey flavors in addition to raisin and brown sugar. A Wow wine where there finish lasts for minutes on end.\n",
      "Actual: Andalucia, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a rich and concentrated Grenache, a bit beyond what's varietally familiar, but it's an undeniably luxurious wine. It offers smoky vanilla, fresh leather, black-cherry jam, black licorice and a touch of fudge on the nose. Caramelized plum and olallieberries meet with balsamic fig and milk chocolate on the palate.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "A straightforward, slightly chunky Côtes du Rhône, with modest cherry fruit tinged with leather, chocolate and licorice. It's medium to full in body, with acids that stick out a bit on the palate, but which should serve it well when paired with burgers or meatloaf.\n",
      "Actual: Rhône Valley, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Made in a crisp, zesty style, this vibrant white delivers tart green apple, Bartlett pear and lemon zest. Bright acidity gives it a clean finish.\n",
      "Actual: Northeastern Italy, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "Fresh raspberry and peach perfume collide into a zesty crush of minerality on the nose and palate of this invigorating dry rosé. It's feather light on the palate but zippy and bright in acidity. The finish is marked by a lingering but delicate bite of astringency. A rosé worth seeking out far beyond the summer months.\n",
      "Actual: New York, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "In its weight and richness allied to scents of garrigue and sun-warmed stones, this speaks of its Tavel terroir. The berry fruit is subdued, with spice, weight and warmth carrying the wine to a long finish.\n",
      "Actual: Rhône Valley, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Squeezed plums and deep pomegranate extract gain some funky complexity from damp mushrooms, sour plum skins and wet wood on the nose of this bottling. The flavors are heavy with juniper, smoked pine and exotic woods, and the dried berry fruit compensates for the herbaciousness.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Taylors (exported under the Wakefield Estate label) is a top-notch source for Cabernet Sauvignon. The 2004 boasts a big nose of cassis, mint or eucalyptus and a touch of roasted peppers. It's mouthfilling, with plenty of soft tannins, then finishes with more cassis and a hint of coffee.\n",
      "Actual: South Australia, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Four vineyards provided the fruit, one third of which was fermented in whole clusters, creating a round, full-bodied wine with lush cherry fruit, streaked with vanilla. Nice spice notes from barrel aging, and a pleasing earthy character underscores the tannins.\n",

      "\n",
      "This is a ripely tannic wine, made from fruit that was sourced from a parcel of more than 40-year-old vines. While it is certainly fruity, rounded and warm, it has tannins as well. It's a velvety wine that retains its structure. Age for the medium term.\n",
      "Actual: Port, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Fruit and barrel mix together on this lightly colored wine with aromas of coffee, herb, woodspice and pepper. The cherry flavors are reserved in style, pulling up toward the finish.\n",

      "\n",
      "Tannic and dry, this wine is beginning to show its age. It still has some juicy red fruits but they are covered by the firm structure and dusty character of the wine. It needs to be drunk now.\n",
      "Actual: Bordeaux, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "A veneer of new wood overlays the aromas of smoke, spiced blueberry, blackberry and olive. Well-proportioned acids and tannins give shape to this medium- to full-bodied effort, which concludes with a seemingly long, clingy finish.\n",

      "Actual: France Other, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "It's no disrespect to say this is a great family restaurant-style Merlot. Tens of millions of Americans dig into beef at the neighborhood joint, and they want a good red to drink alongside it.

      "Actual: Burgenland, predicted: Austria\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a minty, ammonia streak of greenness that can charitably be described as gooseberry in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Oak brings sweet vanilla richness, but the wine is still pretty eccentric.\n",

      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard tannins currently lock this wine down. Although it's astringent, it's very polished and complex. Made from Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, it's marked by black cherry, red currant and cedar flavors, and finishes totally dry.

      "Very rich, ripe and dramatically textured, this has explosive flavors of blackberry, crème de cassis, dried herb and smoked meat flavors, enriched by smoky oak.

      "Corley builds its reserve Cab for the long haul. The wine is too tannic to enjoy now, numbing the palate with dry astringency.

      "\n",
      "The bouquet seems nutty and salinic, and overall this extra dry (meaning fairly sweet) focuses on soft and sugary mango and melon flavors. It's not as lively as it needs to be to balance the sweetness, so ultimately the wine comes up a touch flat. Imported by Freixenet USA.\n",

      "\n",
      "There's a broad, chewy quality to this wine with layers of ripe fruit, spice, leather, tobacco and maple syrup. It is balanced and complex with smooth texture, polished tannins and good structure.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a subtle and intriguing bottle, crafted from a range of sources, offered in significant quantities (16,300 cases) and showing varietal fruit, spice and a deft touch with the barrels. Not a big wine, but balanced and quite flavorful, with more depth than you expect at this price point. Lots of chocolate and spicy burnt coffee in the finish.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Underbrush, red berry and coffee bean lead the nose while the light-bodied palate offers red cherry, clove and a hint of grilled sage. It's easygoing, with loose-knit, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy now.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "Dried plum, mission fig, savory soy, roasted meats and an array of seasonings show on this blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 22% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. Blueberry, soy and beef-roast flavors swirl on the palate, along with candied grape, cedar and graphite minerality.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Hints of savory earth mingle with fresh apple notes. The palate has the bright mellow freshness of ripe oranges and the juiciness of ripe pear. A core of bright lemon acidity makes for a clean, bright and refreshing finish.\n",
      "Actual: Alsace, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Stalky, soupy berry aromas come up shy on elegance. This feels clampy and hard with rocky tannins. Standard berry fruit flavors are overshadowed by gritty stalky blackened accents, while the finish is grating and uncushioned but long.\n",
      "Actual: Northern Spain, predicted: Spain\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first all-estate-grown Chardonnay bottled by Woodward Canyon since 2003. Fermented in one-year-old Burgundy barrels, it's a Washington Chablis that brings exceptional focus and persistence to bear on flavors of intense citrus, honeyed candy, orange peel, spice and even a slim hint of chocolate. The mix of fruit, herb and mineral combines to create a terroir-laden wine that is beautifully complex and proportioned.\n",
      "Actual: Washington, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "This vineyard was developed between 10 and 20 years ago. The maturing vines deliver a supple yet firm wine, anchored in a core of candy cherry fruit. Aromatic and flavorful highlights of cinnamon, clove and candied orange are also in play, along with a subtle hint of herb.\n",
      "Actual: Oregon, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "More savory and spicy than fruity, this Sangiovese-Merlot-Sagrantino blend shows cured meat, tobacco, leather and black currant aromas. The finish is polished and firm.\n",
      "Actual: Central Italy, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "A delicious, savory nose of marinated beef, basil, chopped herbs and spice give this Merlot an enticing start. On the palate it's a chewy, earthy red with blasamic and pepper accents. A very interesting wine with solo sipping appeal, though pair with duck or a steak for added appeal.\n",
      "Actual: Stellenbosch, predicted: Italy\n",
      "\n",
      "A big, soft and expressive wine, this will appeal to a wide range of palates with its fair price and easygoing tannins and integrated oak. Between the juicy blackberry and blueberry, hits of espresso take it to more luxurious places.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Reserved aromas of Rainier cherry, strawberry preserves, herbs and fig lead to plump, silky fruit flavors. It's a very pretty representation of the vintage.\n",
      "Actual: Washington, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Fresh, fragrant and aromatic, this is a clean, clear, limpid wine. Its white fruit flavors are refreshingly crisp, offering delicious acidity. Finishes with a lively citrus aftertaste. Screwcap.\n",
      "Actual: Kremstal, predicted: France\n",
      "\n",
      "Tart cranberry and Morello cherries are layered with delicate tones of smoke and bramble wood in this bright, brisk Pinot Noir. It's delicately framed, yet penetrating and ripe. A crush of wet mineral tones carries through a moderately long finish.\n",
      "Actual: New York, predicted: US\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of fruit flavors and lots of tannin make this both generous and a bit tight at the same time. While the ripe black cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors are tempting, the texture is firm and may need until 2018 to smooth for best drinking.\n",
