I would prefer a bit more new oak, but even so there is a pleasant toasty bite to the finish.\n",

Great potential; hold two to five years at least.\n",

      "Actual: New York, predicted: California\n",
      "\n",

      "Actual: Beaujolais, predicted: Bordeaux\n",

      "\n",
      "This is one of a range of three wines from different soils. Silex soil is flinty, giving, as here, ageworthy, structured wines. It is dense, powerful and with a range of steely textures that dominate the very crisp, taut and nervy fruits. Drink this from 2017.\n",

      "Actual: Southwest France, predicted: Bordeaux\n",
      "\n",
      "Enticing aromas recall pressed rose, blue flower, crushed berry and tilled earth. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed strawberry, cake spice and savory herb alongside assertive but fine-grained tannins. It's well balanced but still young and needs time to unwind.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Piedmont\n",

      "\n",
      "Pungent and pure up front, this 12-year-old Palo Cortado smells nutty and like toffee, with notes of orange peel and apricot. The palate reflects the bouquet, meaning it's clean and exact, with buttery flavors of dried nuts and not too much salt. This runs smooth on the finish and would be ideal in a savory soup or with sautéed mushrooms.\n",
      "Actual: Andalucia, predicted: Mendoza Province\n",
      "\n",
      "Eight months on lees before bottling give this wine its rich, concentrated character. Melon and green-plum fruits are poised and stylish, pointed up by a touch of pepper. It is ripe, full bodied, ready to drink in 2017.\n",
      "Actual: France Other, predicted: Loire Valley\n",
      "\n",
      "This open, fruity wine is named after Cape Bojador in the western Sahara, which Portuguese sailors rounded in the 15th century on their way around Africa. The wine's red fruits and acidity are easy, ripe and with a juicy aftertaste.\n",
      "Actual: Alentejano, predicted: Provence\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an instantly loveable Grenache, bursting with ripe, sweet raspberries and cherries. Young and fresh, it's like sucking on a really good candy; then it finishes with a flourish of toast and mocha.\n",

      "\n",
      "Broad, ripe style, concentrated while retaining lightness of touch. There is a good mineral element balancing the yellow fruits and rich texture.\n",

      "There are pure lemon and lime flavors on this light, crisp wine, along with quite a bite of salt and green-apple-skin tannins. Attractive and fresh, drink this summer.\n",
      "Actual: Loire Valley, predicted: Burgundy\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a hint of sweetness can be found in a bouquet of honey-dusted flower. Pretty in on the palate, with citrus and apricot notes, this shows floral accents that are somewhat reminiscent of Gewürztraminer.\n",
      "Actual: Washington, predicted: New York\n",
      "\n",
      "Dusty rocks, smoke and spice notes cast an intensely mineral haze to this dry Riesling. It's a sharp revitalizing wine, brightened by zesty lime and lemon flavors that shimmer through a long finish. Drink now through 2020.\n",
      "Actual: Rheingau, predicted: New York\n",
      "\n",
      "This features savory aromas of cured meat and smoked hickory sauce. The quality of the fruit is dried and candied, with hints of cassis, prune and raisin. The finish shows acidity and an almond-like bitterness.\n",
      "Actual: Southern Italy, predicted: Veneto\n",
      "\n",
      "This twist-top take on a red Italian table wine is perfect for pizza, pasta or hamburgers, with black plum, cola and pressed purple flower aromas. Olallieberry, plum and licorice flavors show on the quite-dry palate, making it a solid weekday wine.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: Veneto\n",
      "\n",
      "Yalumba's western outpost has been steadily improving the quality of its wines, and the 2010 21 Barriques represents its top wine to date. The dark fruit flavors are accented by ample amounts of charred oak, but the fruit ultimately wins out. The result is a very drinkable, silky textured wine with a long, toasty finish. Drink now–2020.\n",
      "Actual: Western Australia, predicted: South Australia\n",
      "\n",
      "Strawberry jam, espresso, toast, menthol and dark spice lead the nose. The straightforward, rather lean palate offers dried cherry, star anise and a hint of tobacco alongside firm, fine-grained tannins that grip the finish.\n",
      "Actual: Tuscany, predicted: Piedmont\n",
      "\n",
      "Bland white-fruit aromas are a bit oily and gritty. This has a watery feel and mildly bitter flavors of white grapefruit, the skin included\n",
      "Actual: Maule Valley, predicted: Mendoza Province\n",
      "\n",
      "This is mostly Syrah, with a dash of Viognier blended in. It's dry, crisp and smooth, with some nice cherry fruit, but there's a green vegetal touch.\n",
      "Actual: California, predicted: Washington\n",
      "\n",
      "Lovely aromas pour from the glass, a heady mix of lime, Asian pear, cucumber and apple. In the mouth some sweet honey pours over the crisp fruit, and the wine feels lush and perfectly melded, despite its youth. Residual sugar is under 2% and the alcohol just 12%.\n",
      "Actual: Washington, predicted: Oregon\n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of Olivier Leflaive's benchmark wines, showing how his winemaker Franck Grux keeps lightness, freshness and complexity all in play. To start, it is firm and austere, then it bursts out with green fruits, toast, white currants and lemon, integrated and balanced. Drink now, or age for 2–3 years.\n",
      "Actual: Burgundy, predicted: Bordeaux\n",
      "\n",
      "The oak influence currently sits high on this blend of 50% Merlot, 35% Syrah and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, offering notes of char, molten caramel, tea and smoky wood. It feels extracted, with easy acids and big, mouth-clasping tannins. Cedar and dried herb accents add interest to the finish.\n",
      "Actual: Virginia, predicted: Washington\n",
      "\n",
      "A subtle, pretty nose of vanilla, cherry and strawberry is backed up by bigger flavors of sour cherry, spice and vanilla. Fun and exuberant but not terribly delicate. A good match with meats and poultry.\n",
      "Actual: New York, predicted: California\n",
      "\n",
      "A beautiful blend of Vermentino, Malvasia and Chardonnay, this has sophisticated tones of exotic fruit, pineapple, peach and apricot. It offers a broad, creamy feel on the palate. These three grapes compliment each other nicely in terms of structure, aromas and texture.\n",
      "Actual: Sicily & Sardinia, predicted: Tuscany\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a finely integrated, rich wine that shows impeccable balance between dusty tannins and juicy dark berry tones. The wood aging shows through in a smooth texture that gives a sense of richness to the ripe fruit. This is an elegant wine that can be drunk now although it will benefit from some aging. Drink from 2017.\n",
      "Actual: Península de Setúbal, predicted: Burgundy\n",
      "\n",
      "A little minty, raisiny and flat on the nose, but still it's appealing. The palate has a condensed, syrupy feel and soft, semisweet flavors of red berry mixed with herbs and pepper. Spicy and a touch hollow on the finish, but still a good value Cab to drink now.\n",
      "Actual: Central Valley, predicted: Mendoza Province\n",
      "\n",
      "Gritty on the nose, this has baked bean, mushroom, roasted plum and earth aromas. It feels blocky and tannic, with some cushion to the palate. Oaky tasting, with prune, vanilla and buttery notes that settle on baked fruit and chocolate. It comes on forceful and heavy and is arguably a little overripe.\n",
